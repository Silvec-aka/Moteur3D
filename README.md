## Project Overview
**Moteur3D-PRAP** is a 3D engine developed as a study project. The engine is implemented in C++ and provides functionalities for creating and manipulating 3D objects, rendering scenes, and performing various mathematical operations essential for 3D graphics.

---

## Features
- **3D Object Creation**: Supports creation of basic 3D shapes such as cubes, spheres, and triangles.
- **Scene Management**: Allows assembling multiple 3D objects into a scene.
- **Mathematical Operations**: Includes vector and matrix operations for transformations and calculations.
- **Rendering**: Capable of rendering 3D scenes (details depend on implementation specifics).
